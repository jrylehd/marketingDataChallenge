# Marketing Data Analysis

As part of a Marketing Data Analysis project for a Junior Market Intelligence Analyst assessment, I conducted an in-depth evaluation of market data to identify key insights and trends. I analyzed the relationship between revenue and clicks across different Data IDs, uncovering how variations in engagement impacted offer selection and overall revenue optimization strategies. Additionally, I examined the growth of Data IDs over time and its influence on revenue and Click-Through Rate (CTR), identifying patterns in audience engagement that informed targeting and campaign effectiveness. Through this analysis, I also determined which Data IDs were most and least effective at reaching their intended audiences, leveraging key performance metrics such as eCPM and CTR to propose data-driven recommendations for improved offer targeting. Lastly, I investigated the weak eCPM performance of the Housing audience, diagnosing inefficiencies in offer distribution and engagement strategies, and suggested strategic adjustments to enhance conversion rates and revenue generation. This project provided valuable insights into data-driven decision-making in marketing, demonstrating how detailed market intelligence can inform more effective campaign strategies.
